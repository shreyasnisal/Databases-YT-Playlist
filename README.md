This repository contains the sql file to populate your database with the data used in my video series.

### Creating the database from the file

To get data from the sql file in your database, download the file tutorialdb.sql from this repository. Next, create a database. Finally, run the command

```mysql -u username -p database-name < tutorialdb.sql```
where _username_ is your mysql username, and _database-name_ is the name of the database you created.

### Updating

To get data for newwer videos, keep an eye on the repository. I will upload the updated sql files here with the video-number in the commit message. In case you're following the entire series, don't forget to give the repository a star!
